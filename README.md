## how to build

i have no fucking idea lol, you gotta get Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime and do some weird hack. I'll probably put the instructions for that if someone is genuinely curious

## source

I stole (NO i didnt steal I just phrased it into C# >:() this code from [Subway Surfers for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jirkavrba.subway-surfers) but I made it better by adding Minecraft Parkour (its more satisfying in my opinion and busses harder) 

## Install for Visual Studio

Microsoft thinks it's a sussy baka extension, I'm talking to support atm to get that resolved. I don't know why. Check GitHub Releases in the meantime.
